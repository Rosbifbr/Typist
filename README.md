# Typist

Typist is a simple but effective voice keyboard for Android. I've decided to code it as most other voice keyboards are terrible and OpenAI's whisper models are getting dirt-cheap to use.

Maube, in the future, it will support local model execution, but for now, it just wraps the OpenAI API and focuses in providing a good experience.
